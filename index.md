### CPSC 120
Lab 5, part 1 was my favorite, as this is the first point where coding started to be easier to follow along with and having a good partner who understands what they are doing. The first part was more straightforward, just having to find an area of a rectangle, which is simple on paper but incorporates using other code files to complete it and checking through most units even though parts of the code were unused.  

Lab 1 was the year's first lab which was another favorite, as I was eager to code and learn how to code. However, as we still need to finish the lab in class, it took outside effort to figure out how to set up a Linux laptop outside of class, not using VS code and instead trying to figure out Ubuntu with my partner. It was an excellent introduction to how labs are completed and a way to learn how to work on them outside the classroom. 

Lab 7, part 2 was also my favorite because I knew how to play poker, but no matter how many times I watched a video on blackjack, I still needed to understand it. Doing the lab helped me know how to play the game, so I can now gamble on it! But also how to be able to code card games with working with the functionality of the game.
